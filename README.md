# Investigate-a-Dataset-No-Show-Appointment

## No Appointment Medical Attendance Analysis

Welcome to the "Investigate-a-Dataset-No-Show-Appointment" repository! This Python project investigates a dataset of medical appointments in Brazil, with a focus on patient characteristics and their attendance or absence from scheduled appointments. The goal is to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing patient attendance at medical appointments.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project include data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. Here's a breakdown of the project components:

1. **Data Wrangling:** In this phase, we clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. We address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure the accuracy of our findings.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The EDA phase aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. We investigate key questions, such as the attendance ratio, the impact of waiting time, the effect of age and gender, and the influence of scholarships and SMS reminders.
