# Customer Segmentation by K-Means, Spectral, and Gaussian Mixture Clustering Models

Welcome to the "Customer Segmentation" project repository! This Python project focuses on segmenting customers using various clustering models, including K-Means, Spectral, and Gaussian Mixture Clustering. The goal is to uncover meaningful customer segments based on their shopping behavior and characteristics. Here's an overview of the project:

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using different clustering algorithms. The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Exploration:** In this stage, we explore the dataset to understand its characteristics and features. We aim to gain insights into the underlying customer behavior.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing involves tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing the dataset for clustering.

3. **Clustering Models:** We apply K-Means, Spectral, and Gaussian Mixture Clustering models to segment customers based on their behavior and attributes.

4. **Evaluation:** The effectiveness of each clustering model is evaluated, and we analyze the resulting customer segments.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

```
CustomerSegmentation/
├── data/
│ ├── Mall_Customers.csv
│
├── notebooks/
│ ├── Customers_Segmentation.ipynb
│ └── ...
├── README.md
└── .gitignore

```


- The `data/` directory contains the dataset used for customer segmentation (`Mall_Customers.csv`).

- The `notebooks/` directory includes the Jupyter notebook `Customers_Segmentation.ipynb`, where different clustering models are applied, and customer segmentation is performed.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Segmentation.git
